DATA AVAILABILITY INFORMATION

FIGUES
Data used for population figures were obtained from the four excel files below.
DataxFigure.xlsx: Cells in red background were cells that show no significant modulation and were not used for analysis. It contains data for Figures 2-6 
Figure5.xlsl: It contains data for Figure 5
CSvsSS AmplitudeandPhase.xlsx: It contains data for Figure 7
phase360deg CSvsSS.xlsx: It contains data for Figure 7
The data in these files correspond to the analysis results from PSTHs. These excel files are self-explanatory. Each column has a title with the type of data included, such as neuronal amplitude, neuronal phase, stimuli amplitude, etc. Also, different spreadsheets are labeled with the data they contain. Data from normal and L7PKCI mice are clearly separate in section within each spreadsheet.
